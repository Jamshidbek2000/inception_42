## What is the project is about?
This project is about creating and configuring 3 services: 
1. NGinX - a web server that delivers the web content from your website.
2. Wordpress - a content management system (CMS) that simplifies the creation and organization of web content, offering a user-friendly platform for website administrators to publish, edit, and manage posts, pages, and multimedia.
3. Mariadb - a database to store and manage structured data, such as user credentials, website content, and application data, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
Each service has to be on a separate docker container.
